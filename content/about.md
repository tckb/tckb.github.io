_Writing a blog post or even maintaining a blog has been a always of interest to me but has been quite challenging, because of various personal and professional reasons. Nevertheless, I [took a jab](http://rand0mbitsandbytes.blogspot.com/) at it several years ago and would even say it worked out for a while but then the interest kinda died off.  Since then, I have been doing several interesting things and the interest jump started again. I will blog here from time to time._
